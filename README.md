# Profit-Analysis-Excel-Power-BI-
This repository contains the analysis and predictive modeling performed on startup data to understand the factors affecting company profit and to build a model for profit prediction.
## Project Overview
The objective of this project was to perform a Regression Analysis on a dataset of 50 startups located in New York, California, and Florida. The goal was to determine how spending on R&D, Administration, and Marketing influences a company's Profit, and to use the resulting model to predict future profit based on input features.

## The project addressed the following core tasks:
### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) & Visualization:
Visualized all features using PowerBI.
Derived key insights and provided inputs/suggestions to the company.
### Regression Analysis:
Performed Multiple Linear Regression to identify the relationship between R&D, Administration, and Marketing spend and the company's Profit.
Assessed the statistical significance and impact of each spending category on the Profit.
### Profit Prediction:
Used the trained regression model to predict the Profit for new, unobserved input features.
